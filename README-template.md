## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I actually, as far as i can remember haven't use the import on CSS for the font before:

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap");
```

and i also remembered some of the text aling properties on CSS: 

```css
.text-container{
    text-align: center;
    justify-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

CSS overall

### Useful resources

- [figma](https://www.figma.com/) - This helped me to accurately see the desing and the spaces between the img and text, i also learn a bit more about figma
